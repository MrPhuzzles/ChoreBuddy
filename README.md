## Description
Originally, we planned to build a website to assist the elderly and disabled with daily duties like mowing the grass and doing standard household chores but in the end, we decided to make it accessible to everyone. We've created a user-friendly service, like Uber, where users can ask for assistance and have it delivered to them. The website's styling was done with Bootstrap. Presently, we use Faker to give sample data including name, email, and location to build seeds files. Users can request assistance or accept a task when they log in, and their history is stored between sessions.
