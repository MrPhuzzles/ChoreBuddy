# Chore Buddy

ChoreBuddy connects users with each other to help with daily tasks. 

## Description
Originally planned to build a website to assist the elderly and disabled with daily duties like mowing the grass and doing standard household chores, but in the end we decided to make it accessible to everyone. We wanted to create a user-friendly service, like to Uber, where users could ask for assistance from a local person who is similar to themselves and have it delivered to them. The website's styling was done with CSS/Handlebars. We presently use the faker API to give fake data including name, age, and profession to build seeds files. The user should have access to past user history and be able to send or request assistance from other users when they log in.
